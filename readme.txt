If you maintain a WordPress site centered around video hosted on YouTube then this is the plugin for you. Never leave your WordPress blog to upload new content to YouTube or to embed videos into posts again. Everything you need to maintain your video centric site is here. Upload new content, delete old content, get other users videos and even track your YouTube analytics right from the WordPress dashboard.

Featuring the most intricate YouTube Plugin to date. Although other plugins allow you to embed YouTube videos, none allow you to upload directly to YouTube from your WordPress dashboard.


**Upload New Content**

Upload new content to your personal YouTube account straight from your WordPress admin dashboard. Through the use of our three step content uploader users will have new content uploaded to their account in no time!

After your video has been uploaded and processed by YouTube you are then able to embed any of those videos into a new post. The uploader comes with built in validation checking so your videos will be uploaded correctly everytime.


**Browse Your Account**

-You can access and browse through recently uploaded content. From here users can preview videos, delete them or embed them into a new post.

-Before embeding any video into a post, users can preview them (in a new tab) to confirm that it is, infact, the video they intended to embed.

-Now you can delete videos from your YouTube account right from the WordPress dashboard. No need to leave your blog to go remove videos from your account. Just find the video you want to remove...select 'Delete Video', and *poof* its gone.


**Keep Up With Your Favorite Users**

You may add up to 4 alternate YouTube accounts to keep track of. After adding the accounts in the settings page their videos will appear inside of recent uploads, below your account content.

This is extremely helpful if you consistently re-post or share your favorite videos on your blog. You can 'follow' users and keep updated with there most recent uploads, and embed their videos right into your posts.


**Browse YouTube Analytics (beta)**

Through the analytics section you can track important video analytic information for the 25 most recent uploaded videos. The analytics section comes with a fully interactive world map and tons of metric information displayed in tables. The analytics section provides users with such important information as:

1. Upload new content directly to your YouTube account without ever having to leave your WordPress environment.
1. Views Per Video
1. Views Per Country
1. Total Likes/Dis-Likes
1. Total Comments
1. Top Performing Videos
1. Total Number Of Favorites
1. Mins. Watched

**Insert New+Existing Content Directly Into Posts**

*New Content*: After a user has uploaded a video to their YouTube account they then have the option of embeding that video directly in to a new post, or just leaving it there for later access. This saves the user a plethora of time by streamlining the process of uploading new content to YouTube and then embeding that content into a new post. Now everything can take place in one spot, the WordPress Dashboard.

*Existing Content*: If you have previously uploaded content on your YouTube account, you can easily access the latest 25 videos where you can embed them into the post or preview them in a new tab. This is an extremely useful feature for users who maintain video heavy sites and need to grab past videos for inclusion in new posts.
